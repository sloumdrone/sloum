# sloum
This repository was built to keep track of changes to SonicPi programs I've been toying around with.
The repository serves the dual function of allowing me to access the code anywhere as well as keep track of changes if the need to revert should come around.

Each file in the repository is a different 'song'.
All code is by me, unless otherwise noted.

Other musical experiements can be found at:
